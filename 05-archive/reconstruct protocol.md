# 6. Reconstruction Protocols: Developing Cognitive Sovereignty

**Target: 2,500 words**

## 6.1 Cynefin Diagnostic Framework (600 words)

### Introduction to Cynefin
- Developed by Dave Snowden
- Framework for sense-making
- Five domains of complexity
- Appropriate responses per domain

### The Five Domains

#### Clear (formerly Simple)
- Known knowns
- Best practices apply
- Sense ’ Categorize ’ Respond
- **Vector territory**: AI excels here
- High digestibility

#### Complicated
- Known unknowns
- Good practices exist
- Sense ’ Analyze ’ Respond
- **Vector vulnerability**: Expertise reduces to procedure
- Medium digestibility

#### Complex
- Unknown unknowns
- Emergent practices
- Probe ’ Sense ’ Respond
- **Sphere requirement**: Cannot pre-determine response
- Low digestibility

#### Chaotic
- No relationship between cause/effect
- Novel practices needed
- Act ’ Sense ’ Respond
- **Sphere essential**: Immediate embodied response
- Very low digestibility

#### Confused (Disorder)
- Not sure which domain you're in
- Most dangerous state
- **Sphere capacity**: Meta-cognition to diagnose
- Cannot be automated

### Why Vectors Fail in Complex/Chaotic
- No predetermined responses
- Context-dependent solutions
- Emergent properties
- Require multidimensional navigation
- Need sphere architecture

### Why Spheres Are Essential
- Can operate across all domains
- Diagnose domain type
- Adapt response appropriately
- Generate novel solutions
- Navigate emergence

### Organizational Implications
- Most important work is complex
- Organizations treat complex as complicated
- Apply best practices where emergent needed
- Systematic incompetence results
- Sphere development becomes critical

- [ ] Kurtz & Snowden - new dynamics
- [ ] Complex adaptive systems literature
