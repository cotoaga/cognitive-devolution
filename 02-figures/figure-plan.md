**Elements**:
- Five domains (Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, Confused)
- For each: Appropriate response type
- Highlight: Where vectors fail, where spheres excel
- Color coding: Red (vector vulnerable), Green (sphere strong)

**Status**: ⬜ Use Snowden's framework, add our annotations
**Priority**: P1 - Critical
**Note**: May need permission to use Snowden's framework diagram

- **Colors**:
  - Primary: Professional blues and grays
  - Accents: One highlight color (orange or red for warnings)
  - Ensure color-blind accessible
  - Must work in grayscale
- **Fonts**:
  - Sans-serif for labels (Arial, Helvetica)
  - Consistent sizing
  - Readable at print size
- **Size**:
  - Full width: 6-7 inches
  - Half width: 3-3.5 inches

### Caption Format
```
Figure [N]: [Brief descriptive title]. [Longer explanation of what figure shows and key takeaway]. [Data source or citation if applicable].
```

### Accessibility
- Alt text for all figures
- Color not sole means of conveying information
- Patterns/textures in addition to colors
- High contrast
- Clear labels

- **Diagrams**: draw.io (free, exports SVG)
- **Data visualization**: R/ggplot2 or Python/matplotlib
- **Conceptual diagrams**: Inkscape (free vector graphics)
- **Quick mockups**: Excalidraw
- **Professional polish**: Adobe Illustrator (if available)

### Style References
- Academic journal figures in complexity science
- Snowden's Cynefin visualizations

## Integration with Manuscript

### Referencing Figures in Text
- First mention: "Figure 1 shows the historical compression..."
- Subsequent: "As seen in Figure 1..."
- Always explain, don't just reference
- Figure should be understandable standalone

### Placement
- Near first reference in text
- Not interrupting argument flow
- Full-page figures at section breaks
- Smaller figures inline
