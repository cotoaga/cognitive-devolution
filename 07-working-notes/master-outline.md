## Critical Path

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Complete Section 3** (Methodological and Theoretical Framework)
   - Draft 2,000 words
   - Integrate thermodynamic framework
   - Establish analytical approach

2. **Define Section 4** Structure
   - Determine content and focus
   - Set word target
   - Create outline

3. **Continue Sequential Writing**
   - Section 6: Contemporary Evidence
   - Section 7: The AI Mirror
   - Section 8: Implications and Reconstruction
   - Section 9: Conclusion
   - Abstract (write last)

### File Management Tasks
- [ ] Update internal numbering in `05-historical-analysis.md` (Section 4 ‚Üí Section 5)
- [ ] Integrate `-2.md` files into main manuscript flow
- [ ] Resolve duplicate structure files vs content files
- [ ] Update all cross-references

---

## Structural Decisions Made

### Section 3 Composition
- **Decision**: Combined Methodological and Theoretical Framework into single section
- **Rationale**: Thermodynamics functions as both method and theory
- **Note**: Previous `04-methodology.md` content now merged into Section 3

### Section Renumbering
- **Historical Analysis**: Section 4 ‚Üí Section 5
- **Reason**: To accommodate expanded front matter (Introduction, Literature Review, Methods/Theory)

### Thermodynamic Framework Position
- **Approach**: Thermodynamics as analytical lens, not metaphor
- **Treatment**: Core to methodology, not peripheral theory

### Confession Literature
- **Classification**: Methodological innovation
- **Role**: Primary empirical evidence source

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Writing
1. Draft Section 3 (2,000 words)
2. Define Section 4 structure
3. Begin Section 6 if time permits

### Research
1. Gather Section 3 citations (5 priority sources)
2. Verify confession literature examples
3. Continue building to 100+ citations

### Integration
1. Update `05-historical-analysis.md` internal numbering
2. Create plan for integrating `-2.md` files
3. Resolve file structure clarity
