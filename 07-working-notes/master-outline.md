### Supporting Arguments
1. Knowledge requires energy investment (Second Law)
2. Historical compression: 18+ Greek types → DIKW poverty
3. Educational systems as vector compression engines
4. Confession literature documents extraction openly
5. LLM architecture mirrors human training
6. Thermodynamically predictable outcomes
7. Sphere development as resistance
8. Binary choice: sovereignty or dissolution

## Notes for Content Writing Phase

### Tone Requirements
- Academic rigor + revolutionary urgency
- Physics-based (non-negotiable)
- Evidence-driven
- Actionable (not just critique)
- Professional but passionate

### Writing Order (Suggested)
1. Introduction (sets frame)
2. Thermodynamic Framework (establishes physics)
3. Archaeological Evidence (shows history)
4. Architecture of Extraction (shows mechanism)
5. AI Feast Timeline (shows urgency)
6. Reconstruction Protocols (shows solution)
7. Implications (opens research)
8. Conclusion (synthesizes)
9. Abstract (summarizes all)

### Daily Writing Targets
- 500-1000 words/day = 14-28 days for first draft
- Allow equal time for revision
- Budget 2-3 months total for complete draft
