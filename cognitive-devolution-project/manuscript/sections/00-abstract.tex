\noindent This paper presents a thermodynamic framework for understanding the systematic transformation of human cognition from multidimensional ``spherical'' architectures to unidimensional ``vectors'' optimized for algorithmic processing. Drawing on evidence from historical educational systems, contemporary organizational failures, and the architecture of artificial intelligence, we demonstrate that knowledge represents a high-energy state requiring continuous investment to maintain organizational complexity. Our analysis reveals that a century-long project to standardize and modularize human cognition---documented in what we term ``confession literature'' from education, management, and technology sectors---has created the precise conditions for AI replacement of human expertise. We trace this transformation from ancient Greek academies (requiring 20+ years of energy investment) through medieval guilds, the Bologna Process, to contemporary micro-credentials approaching thermodynamic zero. The paper introduces the equation: $\text{Cognitive Sovereignty} = \frac{\text{Energy Invested}}{\text{Time}} \times \text{Resistance to Extraction}$, where resistance correlates with architectural complexity. Evidence from transformation failure rates (70-88\%), AI implementation disasters, and German engineering education resistance validates our thermodynamic model. We conclude that the choice facing individuals and institutions is binary: invest energy in sphere reconstruction or accept entropic dissolution. Physics doesn't negotiate.
