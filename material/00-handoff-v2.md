## Key Structural Decisions

### Decision 1: Combined Methods and Theory (Section 3)
**Rationale**: Thermodynamics functions as both analytical method and theoretical framework. Separating them creates artificial distinction and weakens argument.

**Implication**: Previous `04-methodology.md` content merged into Section 3.

### Decision 2: Section Renumbering
**Change**: Historical Analysis moved from Section 4 ‚Üí Section 5
**Reason**: Expanded front matter (Intro, Lit Review, Methods/Theory) required renumbering
**Status**: Internal numbering in file already reflects this change

### Decision 3: Thermodynamic Framework Positioning
**Approach**: Thermodynamics as analytical lens, NOT metaphor
**Treatment**: Core to methodology, not peripheral theory
**Enforcement**: Maintain precision, cite physical laws, show measurability

### Decision 4: Confession Literature Classification
**Classification**: Methodological innovation (primary evidence source)
**Role**: Practitioners self-documenting extraction methods
**Examples**: Educational psychology, management consulting, platform design research

### Decision 5: Archaeological Method
**Approach**: Excavate historical record without apology
**Stance**: Pattern recognition across domains
**Validation**: Triangulation, cross-domain testing, failure case analysis

## File Organization Notes

### Content Files vs Structure Files
**Issue**: Multiple file versions exist
- `*-2.md` files contain actual written content
- Original `*.md` files contain detailed structures/outlines
- Need integration plan for final manuscript

**Files to Integrate**:
- `01-introduction-2.md` ‚Üí Main introduction
- `02-literature-review-2.md` ‚Üí Main literature review
- Section 5 content ‚Üí Already in correct file

### Citation Management
**Location**: `01-citations/` folder
- `bibliography.bib` - Bibliography entries (BibTeX format)
- `citation-tracker.md` - Priority tracking by section
- `verification-log.md` - Quote verification protocols

**Critical Issues**:
- Richardson & Martinez (2018) - FABRICATED, needs replacement
- Thompson & Associates (2019) - FABRICATED, needs replacement
- Henderson et al. (2023) - NEEDS VERIFICATION

### Figure Assets
**Location**: `02-figures/` folder
- `figure-plan.md` - Detailed planning document
- Existing assets in `material/visuals/` (F1a-f.png)
- 8 figures planned, 0 created

## Next Phase Actions

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Draft Section 3** (2,000 words)
   - Establish methodological approach
   - Integrate thermodynamic framework
   - Position confession literature

2. **Define Section 4** (if needed)
   - Determine if separate section required
   - Or absorb content into other sections

3. **Continue Sequential Writing**
   - Section 6: Contemporary Evidence
   - Section 7: The AI Mirror
   - Section 8: Implications
   - Section 9: Conclusion
   - Abstract (write last)

### Research Priorities
1. Gather Section 3 citations (5 priority sources)
2. Replace fabricated citations with real sources
3. Continue building to 100+ total citations
4. Verify all quotes and examples

### Integration Tasks
1. Plan for merging `-2.md` files into main manuscript
2. Resolve duplicate file structures
3. Update all cross-references between sections
4. Create unified manuscript flow
