I would like to start the introduction with somethig as:
In the current days we, experts in our field, tend to have a higly simplified even naive concept of other SMEs: someone who can apply a larg set of formulas. someone knowing the "right" distributions or gradients for specifiv values. someone who knows how those gradients evolved over time. someone who is able to apply the right "context", as one value at one point in time may be good but in a different context at another time not. For ourself we would always claim: the  is far more that you can not pull out of my head. Let's also put asside the illusion of rationality.
This simplified SME is the direct result of our organisations and systems who have aranged perfectly around the DIKW pyramid.
We have been trained to percieve wisdom, that is directly derivable from data and aggregated through formulas and algorithms into information and knowledge.
This is a very dangerous oversimplification that is today deeply embedded in our society, even though there is plenty of material proving it is an oversimplification.

Regardless of this, we all know, that a master Chef is more as a reciepe repository. It is one of the last trades, that is very similar to what the medievalguilds once practiced.

The last example, everybody of us can relate to is: do you want to be treated by a joung physician with 1000 micro-credential badges or by sombody who has practiced for decades.
